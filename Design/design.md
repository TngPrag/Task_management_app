# Project Description

## Client Description
Develop a web-based task management application where users can:
- Register and log in.
- Create tasks and assign them to other users.
- Mark tasks as complete.
- Utilize both front-end and back-end components.

## Developer Description
- **Architectural Paradigm:** Microservices with Clean Architecture
- **Design Pattern:** Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- **API Type:** RESTful HTTP API

## Conceptual Description
The task management app will support multiple admins, each managing their own set of users. Admins can:
- Create, assign, and update tasks for their users.
- View task statuses and overall progress.
- Receive notifications when task deadlines approach.

Users can:
- View tasks assigned to them.
- Update task statuses.
- Receive notifications when assigned a task.

Admins will also have access to task analytics, including:
- Number of completed tasks.
- Number of in-progress tasks.
- Number of uncompleted tasks.
- Number of users managed.
- Task statuses displayed in a table.

## Problem Modeling Framework
- **Identity:** Defines user behavior and roles.
- **Domain Entities:** Represents atomic objects of the app.
- **Capabilities:** Outlines permissions for each identity.
- **Microservices:** Establishes well-defined, separate concerns.
- **Values:** Features provided to each user role.

### Identities
- **Super-Admins:** Owners of the application who register admins.
- **Admins:** Manage tasks and oversee specific groups of users.
- **Users:** Execute assigned tasks under an adminâ€™s supervision.

### Values
#### Admins
- Create and assign tasks to users.
- View task performance and analytics.
- Receive email/alert notifications for incomplete tasks.

#### Users
- View assigned tasks.
- Update task statuses.
- Receive email notifications when assigned a task.
